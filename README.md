# minback-cleanup
**Minio Rolling Backup Management Container**

This container provides a clean, job based, approach to rotating backups
on a schedule according to given rules. It is intended to be used in
conjunction with the various `minback` containers which place backup
files in a Minio bucket for you.

## Features
* Allows multiple backup retention periods to be selected
* Lightweight and short lived
* Simple and well tested Go implementation

## Example
In this example, let's assume we have a very aggressive backup schedule that
creates a new backup every minute. We would like to keep:

 - Every backup for the last `1h`
 - A backup every `15m` after `1h`
 - A backup every `1h` after `6h`
 - A backup every week (`7d`) after 1 week
 - A backup every 4 weeks (`4w`) after a month (`4w`)
 - A backup every year after 3 years (`156w`)

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file backup.env minback/cleanup cleanup --db my_db --keep "~1h/15m" --keep "~6h/1h" --keep "~7d/1w" --keep "~4w/4w" --keep "~52w/156w"
```

#### `backup.env`
```
MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecret
MINIO_BUCKET=backups
```
